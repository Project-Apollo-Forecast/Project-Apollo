# Blue Chip Capstone
***

## Project Description:
- This project predicts the next quarter's revenue for U.S blue chip companies (Ford Motor Company, Starbucks, and ATT), based on 80 quarters (20 years worth) of various economic, social, political, and environmental factors.

## Project Goal:
- The goal is to use generic data available to the public rather than industry-specific data or company-specific data to make a good total revenue prediction, better than predicting the average.

"Everything, Everywhere, all at once" â€” this profound quote encapsulates the concept of the interconnectedness of all things across different locations and scenarios, occurring simultaneously. With this in mind, our project focuses on uncovering influential features within data segments from diverse sectors, which can have substantial impacts on revenue performance. By acquiring these subtle insights, decision-makers can be equipped with advanced knowledge of the external factors influencing their revenues, enabling them to adapt their business strategies accordingly.

With the above in mind, some initial questions we had:
- Are our target variables normally distributed?
- What features are statistically significant to our targets?
- Can the same features work for multiple targets? (Targets tested separately)
- What are the impacts of negative and positive correlating features?

During the "Acquire" phase of our project, we collected a rich dataset comprising 40 features meticulously sourced from over 17 distinct websites. Notable among them are:
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- Bureau of Labor & Statistics (BLS)
- Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
    
Bringing all this valuable data together, we created a unified and coherent dataframe. This comprehensive dataframe incorporates data spanning two decades, encompassing 80 quarters. Each row represents one quarter, containing all pertinent revenue figures and associated features. See data dictionary below:

#### Data Preparation Process:
    
***
    
- Most of the financial data we encountered was relatively clean and had minimal null values.
- The null values we did encounter were mainly due to missing data that did not extend beyond 2020.
    

***
    
#### Handling Missing Values:
    
***
    
- For variables where it made sense, we filled in missing values using a 3-period weighted moving average.

- However, for variables where filling in missing data would be unreliable, we decided to drop those variables.
    
***
    
#### Adjust Monetary Variables
    
***
    
- We used the CPI method of deflating all of our monetary variables. 
    - The Formula is as follows: 2003 Price x (2023 CPI / 2003 CPI) = 2023 Price
    

    
***    

#### Dataframe Preparation for Exploration:
    
***

1. First, we lagged the revenue back one quarter. This ensured that revenue would be predicting the quarter ahead of it. For instance, 2022 Q4 data would be used to predict 2023 Q1 revenue.

2. Next, we removed the top row, which contained data relevant to predicting Q3 2023. (Unnecessary for this study)

3. Finally, we isolated 1 line of data. Q1 2023 data was removed and set aside as a separate 1-line dataframe. This dataframe will be used to predict Q2 revenue for Ford, ATT, and Starbucks.

#### Data Split and Model Selection:

***
    
- At the outset, we divided our data into training and test sets following a 70/30 split. As our modeling approach incorporates GridSearch, a traditional train-validate-test division was deemed unnecessary.

***
#### Testing for Normalcy and Statistical Methodology:
***
- To ensure the reliability of our analysis, we applied the Shapiro-Wilks test to examine the normality of our target variables. Notably, none of our targets exhibited a normal distribution. Acknowledging this, we opted for the utilization of appropriate statistical methods suited for non-parametric data.

***    

#### Spearman's Rank Correlation for Continuous Variables:

***
    
- To gauge the relationships between our continuous variables and targets, we employed Spearman's rank correlation test. This rigorous examination allowed us to test each variable for significance concerning each target.

***
    
#### Data-Driven Approach to Feature Selection:
    
***
    
- Remaining unbiased, we allowed the data and statistical tests to guide our feature selection process. Consequently, we prepared three distinct sets of features based on what was statistically significant to each of our targets: Ford, AT&T, and Starbucks.

- By adopting this meticulous approach, we have laid a robust foundation for our predictive modeling and analysis, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of our results.

***
    
#### Feature Selection with KBest:

***    

To enhance our model's performance, we initially scaled the data and employed the KBest method to identify the most important features for each target:

- After KBest feature selection:
    - Ford: 15 features
    - Starbucks: 19 features
    - AT&T: 13 features

***
    
#### Regression Models and GridSearch:

***    

Subsequently, we simultaneously employed GridSearch to explore various hyperparameters for the following regression models using the selected features from the training data:

- LassoLars
- Generalized Linear Model
- Polynomial Regression

If polynomial regression degree = 1 was chosen as the best model, this would be equivalent to Ordinary Least Squares regression.

***
    
#### Model Evaluation:
    
***    

To assess model performance, we measured two key metrics on the training data: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$):

- RMSE: The average difference between predicted and actual values.
- $R^2$: Also known as the coefficient of determination. This value represents the percentage of the variance in our target variable that is explained by our independent variables.

***
    
#### Selecting the Best Model:

***    
    
We selected the model that demonstrated the lowest RMSE and the highest $R^2$ values. This top-performing model was then utilized to predict values on our test dataset.

***
    
#### Predicting the Next Quarter:

***    
    
Finally, using the one-line data frame in concert with the best performing model, we made predictions for the next quarter.
